# Changelog
Everything changed for each and every update.

## - 1.0 (aka 2.0):

Welcome to the all new MC23hub, the successor of iSite. With this massive update we get a big refresh with a new design and finally support for other devices than computers. We now also have a whole account system and the page now uses APIs to always show a players skin and name. Because of the whole redesign the website is now orginised with easy to use ux. Lastly, I've made this documentation making the whole project alot more professional. Sadly im still a single developer working on the project so updates will continue to take long time to be released, even longer since I've got some other projects I want to do. Thats basically all for this really needed update, hope you all enjoy it!
